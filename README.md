# Soundsphere Skinning Tool
A tool for making and editing skins for the rhythm game [Soundsphere](https://github.com/semyon422/soundsphere).

Because I haven't come far at the actual convert part, It's more of a template for drag, drop and edit applications.

**Active Development:** 2019-10-05 - 2019-10-12<br>
**Last Change:** 2019-12-25<br>
